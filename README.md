# Star_Classification
In the galaxy's far reaches, the United Intergalactic Council (UIC) has undertaken an ambitious project to catalog all the stars in the known universe. As part of this project, a dataset has been collected containing various features of stars, such as absolute temperature, relative luminosity, relative radius, absolute magnitude, star color, spectral class, and star type.

The UIC has categorized the stars into six unique and fascinating types (fictional names):

Crimson Dwarfs
Umber Dwarfs
Pearl Dwarfs
Aurelian Mainstays
Celestial Sovereigns
Cosmic Behemoths
In this notebook you will find Machine-learning models to predict these extraordinary star types based on the given features.
